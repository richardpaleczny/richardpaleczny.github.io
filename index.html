       learn about HTML - but it does seem pretty interesting so far. </strong>

    <h5> What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one versus the other? </h5>
    <li> <p> I think the difference is that "switch" statements are more for matching cases, similar to chained "if/else if" statements, albeit
    in an easier format to read. I would use "switch" statements if I were trying to match a large number of cases, so that the person reading
    the code would be more able to quickly process what's happening. General "if/else" statements have a large number of uses - in particular,
    in checking certain logical conditions or if there had to be nested "if" statements for more specific actions. I find it easier to write them out
    when there are not a lot of redundant checks that have to be made (in this regard, switch statements might look nicer). They're more useful
    at refining the logic to solve a problem. But I think "switch" and "if/else if" statements are probably interchangeable. </p> </li>

    <h5> What experience do you have coding? What have you created already? What do you want to create during/after the program? </h5>
    <li> <p> I have some experience with statistical programming languages like R and SAS, having taken a semester worth of courses.
    I also have worked with mySQL commands a bit, which I learned from Khan Academy. Although, to be honest, I haven't used these languages in a while
    and am quite rusty. With these languages, I have parsed through raw information and done standard statistical analyses on them, as well as producing
    tables and graphs. In the program, I'm more interested in creating applications - things that people can interact with. I want to be able to
    use all my skills to better understand how to gather information/data, process it in a useful application which is serving a use for actual people. To this end,
    I'm uncertain what exactly I'd like to make, and my options are open. I have some ideas, but they could use refinement - hopefully, I'll pick up the skills
    during this program which will help me make those applications come to fruition.</p> </li>

    <h5> What is your ultimate goal in attending Skill Distillery? How are you going to achieve it? What is your big 'why'? </h5>
    <li> <p> My ultimate goal would be to have the skills to be able to come up with an idea and actually turn it into reality; so to understand how the process works,
    how to allocate resources, expedite workload, understand how to collaborate effectively, work with API's, websites, backend, etc. to create a fully functioning
    piece of software, website, or general application. I have ideas of things I'd like to make, but need the knowledge to get them started. Furthermore,
    Skill Distillery might provide me a career in development, a strong foundational network, and the tools to be able to know where to look for my own further edification
    in the programming world. It's fun to "create" functional software and put pieces together to solve real problems. </p> </li>

    <h5> What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? Where does this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in ‘java.util.Scanner;’? </h5>
    <li> <p> I believe this is a line of code which brings in the java library, methods, and objects necessary to read from standard in. So, I think that
    'java' is like a large class? containing many standard objects held in a package (available online), a library. "util" might be an object in the "java" class, which itself
    contains an object, "Scanner", which is used to read from standard in. We have to import "Scanner" because it doesn't exist locally, or because it's just a lot easier
    to import an object which has already been created to perform reading standard in than to make it from scratch. In this way, we can improve efficiency of code,
    getting more at what we're trying to solve rather than reinventing the wheel, so to speak. </p> </li>

    <h5> What is the difference between ‘while’ and ‘do while’ loops? Give an example of when you would use one versus another. What is the benefit of a ‘do while’ over a ‘while’? </h5>
    <li> <p> A "while" loop will repeat its code block as long as its conditional statement is "true". Similarly, a "do while" loop will also continue to loop while its
    conditional is "true", but the caveat is that a "do while" loop also performs its code block exactly once before its conditional gets checked. This is the basis for using
    a "do while" loop - and perhaps that's because you might not be really sure whether to check the condition until something happens - e.g. prompting a user for information,
    getting their input, and based on that input, decide whether or not to keep running the loop - but you have to run the block at least once to prompt them in the first place,
    say. Alternatively, you could perform the same logic without the "do while" loop, but it's just easier to use the "do while" loop in this regard. </p> </li>
